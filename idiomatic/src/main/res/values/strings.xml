    <string name="about_description">Design: Florent Crivello\nCode: Elodie Ferrais\nTranslations from Linguee\n\nWe\'ve crafted Idiomatic with love, solely motivated by the use we would ourselves make of it (plus the fortune and glory) . Because like you, we\'ve often found myself in situations where translating a single word wasn\'t enough.\n\nWe did our very best - because we love you, dear user - but if you have any comment to make about Idiomatic, feel free to drop us an email at the address elodie.ferrais@gmail.com (or using the button below).</string>
